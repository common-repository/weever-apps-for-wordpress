Weever Apps: Turn your site into a true HTML5 'web app' for iPhone, Android and Blackberry - weeverapps.com

== Description ==

** DEPRECIATED ** - please use version 2 'appBuilder for Wordpress' for new apps - http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/weever-apps-20-mobile-web-apps/

Weever is a new service that turns your WordPress site into a mobile web app for iPhone, Blackberry Touch, Android and iPad.

Weever functions and feels like a native iOS, Android, or Blackberry app, except with no App Store barriers!

This plugin enables you to build and manage your app entirely within WordPress' administrator backend, utilizing best practices to present your content for a mobile-specific context. App users will be able to quickly and easy find your latest news, follow your social network feeds, touch to make a phone call or email you, watch your videos, browse your photo feeds, and more.

Setting up a Weever App is extremely easy. All you do is:

- Sign up for an subscription key at http://weeverapps.com/pricing
- Install the plugin
- Paste in the API key
- Start adding content and branding to your app!

The plugin will forward the devices you specify to your app, and automatically provides the app with the most up-to-date info, so you do not have to manage both your app and your site.

Currently supports:

- Blog content from pages, categories, tags, and custom taxonomy
- Creation of a landing page or a slide-show using Wordpress page content
- Contact information
- Social: Twitter, Facebook, Identi.ca
- Video: Youtube, Vimeo
- Photo: Flickr, Picasa, Facebook Albums, Foursquare Venue Photos
- Events: Google Calendar, Facebook Events
- Forms through Wufoo
- Maps using geolocation stored in posts (using the Wordpress mobile apps for iPhone, Android and Blackberry, or the official Geolocation plugin)
- App works for iPhone/iPod/iPad, Android devices, Blackberry touch devices, with further compatibilities coming soon.

Additional Features:

- Staging Mode: allows developers to play around with new layouts or work on an app for a new version of a site without needing another API key and without affecting a Live app.
- QR Codes: This extension will generate QR codes both for quick previewing of your app as you're building it, and for promoting your app publicly.

1. Copy templates/weever-content-single.php in the plugin folder to your current theme to customize the look of individual pages / posts, or rename to weever-content-single-{posttype}.php to override only for certain post types (standard or custom)
1. Add custom CSS in the 'Logo, Images and Theme' tab, under 'Advanced Theme Settings' or add a file named weever.css to your current Wordpress theme

You can determine the appropriate CSS classes to use by loading your private app URL in a Webkit browser such as Google Chrome or Safari, and inspecting the appropriate HTML elements.
